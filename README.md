# CiviScope

Open-source governance briefs and tracking for Ethereum DAOs.

## Overview

CiviScope distills the torrent of DAO governance activity into a single, trustworthy inbox. It collects proposals, context, and timelines so delegates and contributors can see what matters most, why it matters now, and how it connects to the values of their community.

## Why CiviScope?

- DAO participants navigate overwhelming proposal volume, scattered context, and inconsistent formats.
- Delegates need reproducible briefs with verifiable sourcing to make accountable decisions.
- Communities thrive when values and votes stay in sync, but most tools stop at reminders and alerts.

## Vision

We are building the first trustworthy AI intermediation layer for decentralized governance. CiviScope aims to:

- surface proposals with the clearest possible map of stakes, deadlines, and history,
- produce briefs that any stakeholder can independently verify and reproduce,
- make governance work legible across forums, voting platforms, and emerging coordination spaces,
- set a standard for transparent AI assistance that strengthens democratic decision-making.

## What to Expect

As CiviScope evolves, expect a reproducible workflow that blends human judgment with transparent automation. Briefs are designed to be neutral, citation-backed, and content-addressable, so every reader can trace the evidence behind each claim and share it without ambiguity.
